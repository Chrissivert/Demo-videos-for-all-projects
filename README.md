# Demo-videos-for-all-projects
Demo videos for all projects that have been completed either personal projects or projects through school.
This repo was made to get an overview of the projects I have worked on. Also due to my school's policy, 
I am unable to make changes to the README of repositories that were closed after the deadline.

Demo videos:

* Zombie-shooter https://youtu.be/cBSTHTtsfBI
* Paths (choice-based game) https://youtu.be/5Rr_P6tBHdY
